## :speech_balloon: Intro

This repository contains our **work performed for the Capstone Project of the MBD-PT January 2022**. Here, you will find several notebooks performing detailed analysis of the data, identification of Market Drivers, segmentation of stores, predictions of future sales and design of appropriate promotional strategies to extract the most value upon Beer sales in Spain, having data for years 2021 and 2022. The **data** used has been provided by Circana and contains beer sales from January 2021 to March 2023.

## :rocket: How to use this repository

Here, you'll find a collection of notebooks, along with three folders: datasets, images, and data_checkpoints.

### Notebooks
The notebooks provided in the main branch have been previously run, as they contain some computationally intensive code snippets that take a significant amount of time to complete. There are several notebooks covering different aspects, and we'll delve deeper into the code in the following sections.

### Datasets
The datasets folder contains various data files, including the data provided by Circana and our master dataset, named `circana_data.csv`. The master dataset has been created by preparing and merging the provided data with additional data obtained from external sources.

### Data Checkpoints
The data_checkpoints folder contains CSV files with the results of applying different algorithms (depending on the specific part being executed). Given the computational and time-intensive nature of the code, the results are stored as checkpoints. These checkpoints can be easily extracted and utilized in other tools, such as business intelligence (BI) platforms.

### Images
The images folder houses various types of images. Some images are used as inputs in our notebooks, while others are generated within the notebooks as graphs. For the sake of reducing the notebook size, the graph images are stored in HTML format. This format enables efficient storage while preserving the visual representations of the graphs. This specific approach is implemented in part 5, which focuses on the promotion strategy.

---

Feel free to explore the notebooks, leverage the provided datasets, utilize the stored results, and examine the images to gain a comprehensive understanding of the project. Our **recommendation** is to first check the actual output of each notebook instead of running all of them. Then, you can go through the data_checkpoints or images to gain a more complete view of the results.
You can also clone the repository and then execute each of the notebooks, starting from part 1. As we are not changing the input data, we will have the same results in the different notebooks. If new data is added (increasing, in example, the time extension, the notebooks could be run against this new data, if the structure of it is not modified)
